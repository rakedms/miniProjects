I have not included OnlyOwner.sol in the contracts since I was facing issue in contract execution.

I have made a sample Mongo Data Base which gets the input from front end and adds the product details to the DB.

Deployed Contract addressed are given in the contracts solidity file. All contracts are deployed in Sepholia test net.
